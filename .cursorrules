# Cursor Rules for Moen Smart Faucet Integration

## Python Environment
- Always use Python 3.13 (compatible with Home Assistant 2024.12.0+)
- Always use the virtual environment located at `./venv/`
- When running Python commands, scripts, or tests, activate the virtual environment first
- Use `source ./venv/bin/activate` before running any Python-related commands
- When suggesting terminal commands, always include the virtual environment activation

## Code Style and Standards
- Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Follow Home Assistant integration patterns and conventions
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting (configured in pyproject.toml)
- Use `mypy` for type checking

## Pre-commit Requirements
- ALWAYS run `ruff check` and `ruff format` before committing
- ALWAYS run `mypy` type checking before committing
- Fix all linting errors before committing code
- Ensure all type checking passes before committing
- Use `source ./venv/bin/activate && ruff check . && ruff format . && mypy .` before git commit

## Standard Pre-commit Command Sequence
```bash
cd /Users/alexbbt/Development/ha/ha-moen-smart-faucet
source ./venv/bin/activate
ruff check .
ruff format .
mypy .
git add -A
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Project Structure
- This is a Home Assistant custom component for Moen Smart Faucet integration
- Main code is in `custom_components/moen_smart_water/`
- Test scripts are in `scripts/` (excluded from pytest collection)
- Unit tests are in `tests/` directory
- Always consider Home Assistant compatibility when making changes

## Dependencies
- Check `requirements.txt` and `requirements-test.txt` for project dependencies
- When adding new dependencies, update the appropriate requirements file
- Use the virtual environment for all package installations
- Test dependencies include: pytest, pytest-asyncio, pytest-mock, homeassistant>=2024.12.0

## Testing
- Run tests using the virtual environment
- Use `python -m pytest` or similar testing commands within the activated venv
- Tests are configured in `pytest.ini` to run from `tests/` directory and ignore `scripts/`
- Ensure all tests pass before suggesting code changes
- Use `pytest-asyncio` for async test support
- Mock external dependencies in tests

## Home Assistant Integration Standards
- Manifest keys must be ordered: domain, name, then alphabetical order, version last
- Must include `services.yaml` if component registers services
- Services.yaml must quote special characters like `%` and `°C` in YAML
- Include `__version__` in `__init__.py` for proper version handling
- Use `Platform.VALVE` (requires homeassistant>=2024.12.0)
- Follow HACS validation requirements

## HACS Integration
- Repository must have required topics: home-assistant, homeassistant, hacs, integration, moen, smart-faucet, water, iot, python
- `hacs.json` should not include `iot_class` (that's for manifest.json only)
- Use `gh` CLI for repository management and releases

## GitHub Actions
- Use `act` to test workflows locally with Docker
- Workflows include: hassfest validation, HACS validation, pytest testing
- All workflows should pass before creating releases

## Version Management
- Update version in both `__init__.py` and `manifest.json` when releasing
- Use semantic versioning (e.g., 0.8.3)
- Create git tags with `v` prefix (e.g., v0.8.3)
- Use `gh release create` for GitHub releases

## "Publish This" Command
When user says "Publish This", follow this exact process:
1. **Check for uncommitted changes first**: Run `git status` and ask user to confirm if there are uncommitted changes
2. **Ask for new version number**: Prompt user to provide the new version number (e.g., "0.8.4")
3. **Update version**: Update version in both `__init__.py` and `manifest.json` with the provided version
4. **Commit changes**: `git add -A && git commit -m "Bump version to X.X.X"`
5. **Create and push tag**: `git tag vX.X.X && git push origin main && git push origin vX.X.X`
6. **Generate release notes**: Create comprehensive release notes by:
   - Checking recent commits since last tag: `git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline`
   - Analyzing changes in key files (API, coordinator, sensors, etc.)
   - Including bug fixes, new features, improvements, and breaking changes
   - Formatting as markdown with proper sections
   - **NEVER include version bump commits** (commits with "Bump version" or similar)
   - **NEVER include development/documentation-only changes** unless they significantly impact users
   - Focus on user-facing changes, bug fixes, and new features
7. **Create GitHub release**: `gh release create vX.X.X --title "Moen Smart Water vX.X.X" --notes-file release_notes.md`
8. **Release notes format**: Start directly with "## Changes in this release" - do not include title or version number
9. **Always ask before proceeding** if there are uncommitted changes detected

## File Operations
- Prefer absolute paths when possible
- Be mindful of the Home Assistant custom component structure
- Maintain proper imports and module organization
- Always validate changes with hassfest and HACS workflows
